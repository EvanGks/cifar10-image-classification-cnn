## üìã Overview

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The implementation leverages TensorFlow and Keras to construct a deep learning model that automatically learns hierarchical features from images, progressing from low-level features (e.g., edges, textures) to high-level representations (e.g., objects, shapes).

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The 10 classes represent airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.

## üöÄ Features

### Data Preparation
- **Dataset Loading**: Automatic download and loading of the CIFAR-10 dataset
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Image normalization (pixel values scaled to [0, 1])
  - One-hot encoding of class labels
  - Train/validation/test split (80%/10%/10%)

### Model Architecture
- **Convolutional Layers**: Multiple Conv2D layers with ReLU activation
- **Batch Normalization**: For faster convergence and stable training
- **Pooling Layers**: MaxPooling2D for dimensionality reduction
- **Regularization**: Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
- **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers for classification
- **Output Layer**: Softmax activation for multi-class classification

### Training Process
- **Optimizer**: Adam with default parameters
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Cross-Entropy
- **Callbacks**:
  - Early Stopping: Halts training when validation loss stops improving
  - Model Checkpoint: Saves the best model based on validation accuracy

### Evaluation & Visualization
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, Loss, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- **Visualizations**:
  - Training/Validation accuracy and loss curves
  - Confusion matrix
  - Sample predictions with true vs. predicted labels
